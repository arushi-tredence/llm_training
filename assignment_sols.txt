Day 1:
1. Can algorithms like SMOTE/ROSE which synthesize new examples from the training data be called Generative AI?
Ans. No. SMOTE works by creating synthetic data points through interpolation between existing minority class examples. 
It randomly selects a point from the minority class and finds its nearest neighbors and creates synthetic points along the line segments joining the minority class point and its neighbors.
Generative AI uses complex models to understand the underlying distribution of the training data and generate new instances that follow the same distribution. 
These models often involve deep learning architectures and can generate highly complex and varied data based on its training vectors.

Day 2:
2. Implement WikipediaQueryRun tool from LangChain and search for Generative artificial intelligence and obtain the content of the page. 
3. Implement a tool using YouTubeSearchTool and YoutubeLoader to search and obtain transcript of a video obtained on searching 'LangChain' in YouTube 
4. Visit python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/ngram_overlap/ and implement n-gram overlap selector
5. Visit python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/similarity and implement semantic similarity selector

Day 3:
6. Implement XML parser
7. Implement YAML parser
8. Download LMStudio/Ollama/oobabooga and run it
